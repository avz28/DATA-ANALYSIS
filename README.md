# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction – Data Analysis Project

In this project, I take on the role of a **Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust**, tasked with evaluating residential real estate market prices. The objective is to predict housing prices using features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, floors, location, and more.

This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** and focuses on applying data analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning techniques using Python.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Analyze and clean real estate data
- Visualize feature relationships with housing price
- Apply regression models to predict house prices
- Interpret model accuracy and feature importance

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, R² Score)

## 📋 Project Steps

1. **Load & Explore the Dataset**  
2. **Check for Missing Data & Clean the Dataset**  
3. **Visualize Relationships (e.g. sqft vs price, bedrooms vs price)**  
4. **Build a Linear Regression Model**  
5. **Evaluate Model Performance (R², MAE, MSE)**  
6. **Use Model to Predict Housing Prices**  
7. **Identify Most Influential Features**
